# Stock-analysis
###### By Omie Roosevelt

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to sum the total daily volumes of each stock ticker and then return a variance percentage value from the beginning to the end of the year.


## Results

Below you will be able to see the value of the input box executed when running the code. It will ask you to put the year that you would like to run to collect and analyze the data that we have established in the workbook. We have 2 years of stock analysis, and the code allows you to enter the year you would like to pull the information from based on the text entered in the input box. Making this code convenient and user friendly for anyone wanting to view the data


###### What year would you like to run the analysis on?

As a result for the refactored scripts, the execution time was conveniently faster than the original script. The refactored script for 2018 ran in 0.04 seconds and as a result, we received the information quickly without having to change the data script by year each time. For 2017, the execution time was increased almost by an entire second more. The variance between the two run times is 0.98 seconds.

## Summary 

The advantage of refactoring the code is the layout and the execution time of pulling information from different data sheets, also the information is clear to understand. This gives users the ability to pull and entire year of information quickly and smoothly. The disadvantages are that the code may be harder to maintain as things change over time. 
These pros can generate quick and easy data in a timely manner for the information provided, whereas the time to developed the factored code and be costly for some companies as well as changes needed through time.
